##### Questions

> Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.



> Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

The command `sort commands.js | wc` output `76  164 1804 commands.js`

This output makes sense because it is the same output as `wc commands.js`. The sort command re-orders the file but does not change the content, so the count should remain the same.


> Given a string, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while maintaining the original word order and whitespace and return the string. To improve your problem-solving experience, use the suggested functions to solve the problem. 

const reverseString = (string) => {
// initialize returned string
  let reversedString = [];
// split original string
  let s = string.split(" ");
// iterate over strings
  for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
    console.log("before: " + s[i].split("").reverse().join(""));
    reversedString.push(s[i].split("").reverse().join(""));
  };
// return joined string
  return reversedString.join(" ");
}
// Test case 
reverseString("Hello There Young Man");
